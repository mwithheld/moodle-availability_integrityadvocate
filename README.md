Overview
--------

Moodle proctoring and identity verification brought to you by [Integrity Advocate](https://www.integrityadvocate.com/partners/moodle). The Integrity Advocate proctoring plugin for Moodle installs in minutes and saves you hours of support emails. Using our proprietary hybrid AI and human powered participation monitoring, we deliver a fast, easy and secure environment that is truly GDPR compliant because it doesn't share or store any unnecessary data.

Integrity Advocate is for online proctoring, identity verification and participation monitoring. You can use it to confirm learner identity, to ensure learner participation during course viewing and/or as an online exam proctor. Integrity Advocate is activated by the learner accepting a privacy policy, participation rules (customizable), granting access to their webcam/mic as well as to the monitoring of their screen activity (optional).

This plugin, [Integrity Advocate restrict access](https://moodle.org/plugins/availability_integrityadvocate) can be added to a Moodle activity and prevents access to activities and resources depending on the Integrity Advocate results in another activity. See also [What are activity restrictions?](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Using_restrict_access).

This plugin *requires* the paid service-plugin, [Integrity Advocate block](https://moodle.org/plugins/block_integrityadvocate).
