Moodle proctoring and identity verification brought to you by [Integrity Advocate](https://www.integrityadvocate.com/partners/moodle). The Integrity Advocate proctoring plugin for Moodle installs in minutes and saves you hours of support emails. Using our proprietary hybrid AI and human powered participation monitoring, we deliver a fast, easy and secure environment that is truly GDPR compliant because it doesn't store any unnecessary data.

You can use it to confirm learner identity, to ensure learner participation during course viewing and/or as an online exam proctor.
