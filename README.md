# IntegrityAdvocate Moodle availability restriction

Integrity Advocate does identity verification & participation monitoring. 

This availability restriction (condition) accompanies the moodle-block_integrityadvocate plugin to prevent access to a course module depending on the IA results in another module.

Requirements, installation, setup, etc can be found in the [Integrity Advocate Moodle plugins wiki](/mwebv/moodle-block_integrityadvocate/wiki/)
